\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}
some open problems: post hoc evaluation of the mixing issue. 

is there optimal annealing schedule.

is there any geometric interpretation of bandwidth

the computation effciency really depends on how fast computing the Hessian, maybe we can use Gauss-Newton approximation? using the outerproduct of grad
